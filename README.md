## How to Use
TubHiderTTV is being submitted to the Chrome Webstore, [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tubhiderttv/ejanakbkdmbojlhlphcnhlbgdbmjkije)(Link is not yet available).
~~To use this extension, you have to download the repository.~~ 

~~*The `blacklist.json` file will also be downloaded, but is unnecessary as the extension uses the link to the Github, so you don't have to download the extension every time I add more thots.*~~  

~~When you have downloaded it, take the `manifest.json` and `script.js` files, put them in a folder, go to `chrome://extensions`, enable Developer Mode by toggling the switch in the top right, reload the page and drag the folder onto the page.~~  
**Now you can enjoy Twitch tubber-free!**
