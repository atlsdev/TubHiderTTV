# ThotHiderTTV
A Browser extension that hides all the th0ts from Twitch Directory pages.
## How to Use
To use this extension, you have to download the repository. 

*The `blacklist.json` file will also be downloaded, but is unnecessary as the extension uses the link to the Github, so you don't have to download the extension every time I add more thots.*  

When you have downloaded it, take the `manifest.json` and `script.js` files, put them in a folder, go to `chrome://extensions`, enable Developer Mode by toggling the switch in the top right, reload the page and drag the folder onto the page.  
**Now you can enjoy Twitch thot-free!**
